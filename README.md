## üöÄ Overview

Companies often struggle with **manual expense reimbursement processes** that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency.
This system provides a **flexible, role-based expense management platform** with multi-level approval workflows and conditional logic for approvals.

**Key Goals:**

* Automate expense submissions and approvals
* Reduce errors and approval delays
* Provide complete visibility for employees, managers, and admins
* Support conditional approval flows and OCR-based receipt scanning

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

### Authentication & User Management

* On **first signup/login**, a new company is auto-created with the country‚Äôs currency set.
* An **Admin account** is automatically created.
* **Admin Permissions:**

  * Create Employees & Managers
  * Assign/change roles (Employee, Manager)
  * Define employee-manager relationships
  * Configure approval rules
  * Override approvals

### Expense Submission (Employee Role)

* Employees can submit **expense claims** including:

  * Amount (multi-currency supported)
  * Category

### Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)

* Conditional approvals supported:

**Workflow Example:**
